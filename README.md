# Student-Final-Grade-Calculation
Here's a simple student final grade calculation project description:

**Project Title:** Student Grade Calculator

**Objective:**

This project aims to automate the calculation of student final grades by reading data from input files and performing weighted averages.

**Features:**

- Reads student information and grades from CSV files.
- Calculates final grades based on pre-defined weights for different assignments or categories.
- Generates a new CSV file summarizing the final grades for each student.
- It generates a bar plot showing the counts of different letter grades
- Additionally, a histogram with a kernel density estimate and a fitted normal distribution is plotted to visualize the distribution of final scores.

**Benefits:**

- Saves time and effort by automating the grade calculation process.
- Reduces the risk of errors in manual calculations.
- Provides a clear and documented record of student grades and their breakdown.
- The script proceeds to analyze and visualize the final grade distribution
- This visualization aids in understanding the overall performance of students and distribution of grades in the class

**Target Users:**

This project can be beneficial for:

- Teachers and instructors who want to streamline their grade calculation workflows.
- Students who want to track their progress and calculate their estimated final grades.
- Anyone interested in automating data processing tasks using Python.

**Implementation:**

The project can be developed using Python and libraries like pandas for CSV handling and NumPy for calculations. 

**Potential Enhancements:**

- Implement error handling for invalid input data.
- Include visualization of student grades using libraries like matplotlib.
- Integrate with a gradebook application for a more comprehensive solution.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Gain experience with Python programming for data manipulation.
- Understand the principles of reading and writing CSV files.
- Learn to apply weighted averages to calculate final grades.
- Discover the benefits of automating data processing tasks.

This description provides a clear overview of the project's purpose, features, benefits, target audience, and potential for enhancement.
